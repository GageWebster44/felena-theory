Felena Theory — Legal Compliance Summary
----------------------------------------

Overview:
Felena Theory is an immersive, non-financial simulation platform that leverages a utility point system ("XP") to grant users access to educational tools, simulations, and algorithmic analysis modules. It is legally classified as a gamified simulation environment and does not qualify as a trading platform, broker, or financial advisory product.

Core Legal Structure:
- XP (Operator Experience Points) is a non-monetary, non-redeemable utility token.
- USD can be exchanged for XP at a fixed rate (1 USD = 1 XP); however, XP cannot be withdrawn, transferred, traded, or redeemed for currency or financial products.
- All in-app actions, including games, simulations, and unlocks, are XP-driven and entirely confined within the platform’s ecosystem.

Key Modules and Their Legal Classifications:

1. Game Room (CRT 3):
   - XP-based simulations resembling slot machines, dice, and card games.
   - No cash prizes or redemptions.
   - Outcomes affect internal XP only.
   - Classified as gamified progression under simulated conditions.

2. Engine Grid (CRT 2):
   - XP unlocks access to simulated algorithmic engines.
   - Engines generate hypothetical ROI and prediction analytics.
   - Engines DO NOT place trades or handle user brokerage accounts.
   - Classed as simulation-only algorithmic access (education and research use).

3. AI Simulator (CRT 4):
   - XP-unlocked forecasting models.
   - Operators input signal logic and market assumptions.
   - Output is educational and non-executable.
   - Simulates technical and sentiment-based behavior only.

4. XP Shop (CRT 6):
   - XP used to purchase boosts, engine access, crates, and cosmetics.
   - No items confer financial gain or asset rights.
   - No cash-to-value transfer is permitted.

5. Override Panel (CRT 9):
   - Admin/test-only screen to inject XP or force-simulate system states.
   - Used strictly for internal development or QA purposes.
   - All overrides are logged and tracked.

6. Anomaly Radar (CRT 5):
   - Detects market behavior patterns (e.g., spoofing).
   - Outputs educational alerts only.
   - No automated response or trade execution.

7. Live Feed (CRT 1):
   - Displays real-time public market data.
   - No trading functionality; for visualization and analysis only.

8. Leaderboard (CRT 8):
   - Rankings based on XP usage, win rates, simulator performance.
   - No cash or prize-based outcomes.
   - Used for gamified ranking.

9. Settings + Profile Console (CRT 7):
   - Customization of UX, autonomy preferences, and notification rules.
   - No financial implications.

Legal Summary:
Felena Theory is:
- Not a trading platform.
- Not a wallet or brokerage service.
- Not a provider of financial advice or recommendations.
- Not offering securities, investment contracts, or tokens of value.

Felena Theory is:
- A simulation.
- A gamified XP environment.
- A progression-based unlock system for algorithmic modeling tools.
- A user-operated experience that mimics financial logic for research, education, and experimentation only.

Conclusion:
Felena Theory operates entirely within legal bounds and maintains strict separation between its internal XP ecosystem and all forms of monetary value or investment activity. All user interactions are non-binding, non-financial, and simulate market behavior for operator education only.
