Receiving Party will (a) use Confidential Information only for the Purpose or as permitted by an SOW; (b) not disclose it except to its employees, contractors, counsel, auditors, and insurers with a strict need‑to‑know who are bound by written obligations at least as protective; and (c) protect it with industry‑standard administrative, technical, and physical safeguards (never less than those used for its own similar information).

4. INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY; ASSIGNMENT; LICENSES
4.1 Work‑Made‑For‑Hire and Assignment. To the maximum extent permitted, Deliverables are “work made for hire” for Felena. If any Deliverable does not qualify, Counterparty hereby irrevocably assigns to Felena all right, title, and interest worldwide in such Deliverables (including patents, copyrights, trade secrets, mask works, database rights, and all extensions/renewals).
